# Kemeny-Optimal-Rankings
Implemented:
1) A brute force version of finding the Kendall Tau Distance between two rankings.
2) A method that, from a collection of rankings, finds the largest geometric distance between any two rankings (using Kendall Tau).
3) Average rank aggregation to find the average ranking among a collection of rankings.
4) An optimal Kendall Tau that runs in O(N log N) time.
